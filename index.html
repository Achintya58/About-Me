  <p>Hi, My name is Achintya and I'm a high school student residing in the state of Massachusetts. I am 16 years old, an avid Celtics and Patriots fan, and love to eat Mexican food. My favorite movie is "The Pursuit of Happyness" and my favorite TV show is "The Office". I have many interests, including sports, airplanes, and of course physics. Most of my interest in Physics comes from my intrigue in understanding and wanting to further learn about how airplanes do what they do. I am also interested in other aspects of Physics as well.</p>
